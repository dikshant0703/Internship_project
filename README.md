Project 1:
Network Vulnerability Assessment:
Objective: To evaluate interns' ability to identify and mitigate
network vulnerabilities. Description: Network Assessment:
Provide interns with a simulated network environment. Ask
them to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment
using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
Vulnerability Identification: Have interns identify at least five
critical vulnerabilities in the network. They should provide
detailed reports on each vulnerability, including its severity,
potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.
Mitigation Plan: Instruct interns to create a mitigation plan for
the identified vulnerabilities. This plan should include step-by-
step instructions for remediation, estimated timelines, and any
required resources or changes to network configurations.


Project 2:
Objective: Investigation of a Data Breach on a Renowned
Website.
Scenario: Imagine that there has been a data breach at a
renowned website, and your task is to investigate this breach.
While the website's name is fictional, the scenario will test your
investigative and forensic skills.
Details: Company Name: ABC SecureBank, a highly reputable
financial institution. Breach Discovery: The breach was
discovered during a routine security audit, and it appears that
sensitive customer data may have been exposed. Scope of
Breach: The breach involves potential exposure of customer
account information, including names, account numbers, and
transaction history.
Tasks: 1. Incident Analysis: Investigate how the breach occurred.
Determine the point of entry, the extent of the breach, and the
timeframe during which it occurred.
2. Forensic Analysis: Conduct digital forensics on the affected
systems to identify any malware or suspicious activities. Collect
evidence and logs.
3. Data Recovery: Determine the type and quantity of customer
data that was potentially exposed. Develop a strategy for data
recovery and incident containment.
4. Regulatory Compliance: Consider the legal and regulatory
aspects of the data breach and ensure that the company
complies with reporting requirements.
5. Communication and Notification: Develop a communication
plan for notifying affected customers, stakeholders, and
regulatory bodies. Ensure that the communication is clear and in
compliance with privacy laws.
6. Post-Incident Review: After the breach has been contained
and mitigated, conduct a thorough review to identify
weaknesses in the security posture and provide
recommendations for improving security.
