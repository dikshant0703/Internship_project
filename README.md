Project 1:
Network Vulnerability Assessment:
Objective: To evaluate interns' ability to identify and mitigate
network vulnerabilities. Description: Network Assessment:
Provide interns with a simulated network environment. Ask
them to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment
using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
Vulnerability Identification: Have interns identify at least five
critical vulnerabilities in the network. They should provide
detailed reports on each vulnerability, including its severity,
potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.
Mitigation Plan: Instruct interns to create a mitigation plan for
the identified vulnerabilities. This plan should include step-by-
step instructions for remediation, estimated timelines, and any
required resources or changes to network configurations.
